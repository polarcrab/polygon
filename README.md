# Polygon
This is a low level library written in C++, which allows us to create convex and concave hull.
The convex hull is based on the Graham's scan method and for finding the concave hull we have used the method given by [A New Concave Hull Algorithm and Concaveness Measure for n-dimensional Datasets*](http://www.iis.sinica.edu.tw/page/jise/2012/201205_10.pdf).
